        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Elisa Noh from Orange County, California. Growing up, I lived in many different cities. For example, I was born in Los Angeles, California, but spent most of my childhood in South Carolina. In middle school, my family moved back to Orange County, California, and I have been living in Southern California ever since. Due to the fact that South Carolina was such a rural state, I was able to do a lot of outdoor activities, which has shaped the person that I am today. I have participated in many sports growing up from soccer to gymnastics to dance to swimming. However, the one sport that I stuck with even through high school was swimming. My love for the water eventually manifested into my love for surfing. Although I'm not good at surfing, I enjoy spending time on wading on a surfboard on the water. I enjoy going to the beach with my friends either to swim in the water or just having a picnic on the sand. During the wintertime, I also like going snowboarding with my family. We take an annual trip during Christmas to Utah, in order to board on the freshest bed of snow. My favorite animal is either a panda or dolphin. I like pandas because they are strong, yet calm animals that spend most of their time chilling, eating, and sunbathing. On the other hand, I like dolphins because I think that they're one of the most majestic creatures of the ocean. One of my bucketlist activities is to swim with a dolphin. Although my favorite cuisine of food is Korean food, my favorite dish is sushi. I like to order salmon sashimi when I go. Another thing that I really like is spending time with children. I feel like when I spend time with children, I am able to unleash my goofy, playful side. That is one of the reasons why I want to work with children as a career. My favorite color is lavendar because it is a feminine color, yet it isn't too overpowering like navy blue or pink. In addition, lavendar is a very soothing color. My favorite subject in school was English, due to the fact that the student is the brain for what is written in an essay or story. My least favorite subject in school was math, due to the fact that there is only path to a correct answer. There is no room for mistakes. My favorite movie is The Greatest Showman, which was released in 2017. I liked this movie because of how wholesome and meaningful the plot line of the movie was. It was a very "feel good" movie that is appropriate for families to watch together. I would describe myself as a joyful, optimistic person. I am also a very self-motivated individual that works to achieve her goals. In high school, I was able to maintain a 4.5 GPA, even though I spent time outside of school participating on the Girls' Varsity Swim Team and working a part-time job. I spent a lot of my time on the weekends volunteering at various non-profit organizations and events as a means to expose myself to various issues that our society faces. I am very excited for what the future has to hold!<br><br>

        I graduated high school with a diploma in May 2019, and enrolled to attend the University of California, Riverside. I attended the University of California, Riverside from September 2019 to June 2022. I graduated in three years with a degree in Education and a concentration in Human Developmental Sciences. One of the reasons why I partook in the Education program at the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Riverside is because I really enjoy education children about school and society in general. I find much joy in watching the development of children overtime. As a high schooler, I volunteered in various capacities at my church. Many of the opportunities that I was apart of included Vacation Bible School and a volunteer at the church's nursery. As a Vacation Bible School teacher, I had to lead activities and lessons that were based off of the bible passages that were taught for that day. This program only lasted for one week during the summer, mostly in the month of July. As a volunteer at the nursery, I had to interact and take care of the babies that were present at the nursery. Many of my interactions involved reading picture books or playing with the children with the toys that were provided. I was a weekly volunteer so I volunteered every Sunday during first service. In addition, in high school, I was apart of the youth group's praise team, which allowed me to truly exercise my leadership skills as a praise leader of 3 years. Although I can play basic chords on the keyboard and guitar, I spend most of my time singing on stage. As a praise leader, I had a lot of responsibilities to complete before the following Sunday. One of the responsibilities as a praise leader was that I had to select songs to perform on Sunday. In addition, I had to regulate and organize the members for each instrument that would be necessary to play the songs. As a college student, I was very involved in clubs and organizations on campus. One of the main organizations that I was involved in was the Korean-American Campus Mission, also known as KCM. Through this organization, I was able to have an outlet to have fellowship with fellow Asian Christians on campus. The events that were partook in were weekly general meetings, weekly Freshmen class meetings, small group meetings, and a program called "Freshman Accountability Fused With Sophomore Accountability" (FAFSA). Through KCM, I was able to network with many individuals that presently work in many different fields. By networking through this club, I was given many opportunities to shadow and volunteer at their workplaces, as a means of exposing myself to different careers. After graduating undergraduate college early, I decided to partake in my church's 1 year internship. I got sent to Indonesia as an intern to help out at the local church for 1 year abroad. Taking this opportunity as an intern truly prepared me for the difficulties outside of the Orange County/Southern California "bubble". As a leader for the childrens' program at the Indonesian church, I had to organize events for the students to do afterschool and take them on field trips. For graduate school, I attended California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) under their occupational therapy program. <br><br>

        Although I did volunteer in a variety of student teacher positions, I decided to become an occupational therapist because of my interest in Human Development, specifically Child Development. While volunteering and working throughout high school and college, I realized that I enjoyed seeing the progress that a child made with their fine motor and cognitive skills. I realized that there are a lot of children that unnoticeably have difficulty performing certain skills that their peers can easily do. After having this epiphany, I asked my aunt if I could shadow her for a day at her Occupational Therapy clinic. She runs a pediatric practice on the weekends, so when I went to shadow her, I was able to see the pure joy that children had while peforming the exercises that my aunt made. It was so interesting to see the one-on-one relationships that she had with each and every single one of her clients. This made me realize that having a one-on-one relationship (which is something that teachers cannot have in the normal classroom setting) is something that I truly value. However, after shadowing various occupational therapists at senior living homes, private clinics, and school clinics, I realized that I really enjoyed shadowing occupational therapists that working in the Neonatal, Intensive Care Unit. I was convicted to work in the Neonatal, Intensive Care Unit because I realized that infants are unable to understand plain human language and instruction, which makes them so helpless. However, with the help of an occupational therapist, infants are able to start (early) with refining their fine motor skills. Therefore, in graduate school, I made sure to volunteer often with occupational therapists that work in the Neonatal, Intensive Care Unit in hospitals. After doing some fieldwork, I was hired at St. Josephs' Hospital in Los Angeles, California. I worked their as an occupational therapist assistant (at first) for 2 years. However, I wanted to work at a hospital closer to my home in Orange County, California, which is why I resigned. Originally, I made an effort to make this 1 hour communte daily for two years; however, I soon realized that it would be better for my mental and physical health to transfer to a nearby hospital in the Orange County area. I really enjoy doing my job daily, and it has become my passion. On the side, I continue to do research on Child Development on the side as a means of broadening my knowledge on how children's minds work, especially as technology continues to progress and modify. Currently, I am doing a research study on the effects of parents allowing their child to watch TV as they eat a meal and the growth of their brain. While conducting this research, it has become apparent to me that allowing children to eat meals in front of the TV impedes on their social skills. However, it strengthens certain skills like multi-tasking and retaining information, especially if they're watching eduation TV programs. I hope to continue expanding my knowledge as an occupational therapist, so that I can further understand the development of children.
